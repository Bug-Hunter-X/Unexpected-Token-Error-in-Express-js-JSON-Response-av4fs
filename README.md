# Unexpected Token Error in Express.js JSON Response

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Express.js applications: the "Unexpected token" error within JSON responses. This error typically arises when the server attempts to send a JSON response that is not valid JSON. 

## Scenario:

The server-side code might encounter unexpected exceptions during data processing or simply return an improperly formatted response. This leads to the client receiving an invalid JSON structure resulting in the "Unexpected token" error.

## Solution:

The solution involves robust error handling and ensuring the data returned as a JSON response is always valid JSON. We handle potential exceptions and carefully format the response to prevent such errors.
